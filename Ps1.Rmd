**and comment on whether or not they are consistent with the quality score plots.**

The N cotent across the bases was consistent in which there was no N bases. The base quality scores were good, specifically 1 to 75-79 in RAL306W-F3_S79_L006 reads.

**Describe how the FastQC quality score distribution plots compare to your own**

The mean score curve in the plots betwwen fastqc and Demultiplixing code looks about the same. The run time was different fastqc was 3-5 fold faster then the demultiplexing code. This can be due to fastqc using bins of base pairs instead of individual base pairs. Also, multithreading can make fastqc more efficient. In addition, fastqc uses the language Java which is fatser than python. Java is a compiled language where it runs faster compared to python as interpreted language.

Table 1
```{r echo=FALSE}
fast_qc_time <- matrix(c("0:14.15","0:13.13","4:21.43", "4:37.23"),ncol=1)
demultiplex_time <- matrix(c("0:48.04", "0:50.98", "21:09.52", "20:44.86"),ncol=1)
time_table<-cbind(fast_qc_time,demultiplex_time)
colnames(time_table) <- c("fast_qc (h:mm:ss)","demultiplexing_code (h:mm:ss)")
rownames(time_table) <- c("RAL306W-F3_S79_L006_R1_001","RAL306W-F3_S79_L006_R2_001"
                          , "RAL306W_plus_M3_S78_L006_R1_001",
                          "RAL306W_plus_M3_S78_L006_R2_001")

(time_table)

 
```
*Table shows the differeces in times running fastqc and python script for the from the R1 and R2 of the 2 demultiplexed file pairs.* 


**Comment on the overall data quality of your two libraries.**

The overall quality data of RAL306W-F3_S79_L006 reads were good. The mean scores curve for 1 to 75-79 where in the green then started to dip into the abnormal. Fastqc summary states that they are good. For RAL306W_plus_M3_S78_L006 R1, the mean score curve was good, good reads overall but started slightly deeping 1 to 75-79. Where for  RAL306W_plus_M3_S78_L006 R2 it was not as good as R1 but the mean score curve did stay in the green started to fall 30-34.

## Part 2 – Adaptor trimming comparison

**Look into the adaptor trimming options for cutadapt and Trimmomatic (all on Talapas), and briefly describe the differences.**

Trimmomatic can read single and paired ends. Removes adapters, leading or trailing low quality bases and N bases. Can cut adapter and other illumina-specific sequences, can cut bases off the start or the end of the read by a threshold quality. Has a sliding window trimming. Can drop read by a specific length. Has the convenience that it decides what adapter to use but can cut out overrepresented areas which can cut more than your adapter

Cutadapt can read single and paired ends. Removes adapter primers, sequences, poly-A tails and other unwanted sequences. Can modify and filter reads in various ways. IUPAC wildcard characters are allowed in adapter sequences. In cutadapt, you have to specify the adapters. It throws out reads that are less than the adapters size.  

For the this assignment I used cutadapt because it was easier to get it running compared to trimmomatic.


**What proportion of reads (both forward and reverse) was trimmed? **

```
**the reasoning behind them, and how you confirmed the adapter sequences.**

The reason behind this was to confirm by greping and word count line of the Illumina adapter sequences, from the R1 and R2 of the 2 demultiplexed file pairs, are in the correct orientation pre-trimmed and absent post trimmed. The  Illumina's TruSeq LT and TruSeq HT-based kits Read 1 and Read 2 adapter sequences were used. The confirmation came from having a large value in the grep word count line using Read 1 adapter on RAL306W-F3_S79_L006_R1_001 and doing the same for Read 2 adapter on RAL306W-F3_S79_L006_R2_001. Which did result into outputing large values. For coriousity, the same commands were used using Read 1 adapter on RAL306W-F3_S79_L006_R2_001 and Read 2 adapter on RAL306W-F3_S79_L006_R1_001 to confirm there was 0 which was the result. This same approach was used for RAL306W_plus_M3_S78_L006 R1 and R2 files. Furthermore, using postrimmed files, these same commands were run and resulted in 0 which is what we expected.

**Plot the trimmed read length distributions for both forward and reverse reads (on the same plot). You can produce 2 different plots for your 2 different RNA-seq samples**

Commands to get the read length distributions.
```{r engine = 'bash', eval = FALSE}
zcat RAL306W-F3_S79_L006_R2_001_cutadapt.fastq.gz | sed -n '2~4p' | awk '{print length($0)}'|\
sort| uniq -c > RAL306W-F3_S79_L006_R2_001_cutadapt_read_len.txt

sort| uniq -c > RAL306W_plus_M3_S78_L006_R1_001_cutadapt_read_len.txt
 
```

Creating Trimmed read length distribution plots
```{r }
M3_R1_txt <- read.table("RAL306W_plus_M3_S78_L006_R1_001_cutadapt_read_len.txt")
M3_R2_txt <- read.table("RAL306W_plus_M3_S78_L006_R2_001_cutadapt_read_len.txt")

F3_R2_txt <- read.table("RAL306W-F3_S79_L006_R2_001_cutadapt_read_len.txt")

par(mfrow=c(1,2))

legend("topleft", legend=c("R1", "R2"),
       col=c("blue", "red"), lty=1:2, cex=0.8,
       box.lty=0)

points(F3_R2_txt[,2],F3_R2_txt[,1], col="red")
legend("topleft", legend=c("R1", "R2"),
       col=c("blue", "red"), lty=1:2, cex=0.8,
       box.lty=0)

```

*Trimmed read length distributions for R1 and R2 of the 2 demultiplexed file pairs. Figure 5 a shows at the beginning read length R1 having less repeated read lengths compared to R2 but then overlapping until last few points. Figure 5 b shows at the beginning reads scattered but some overlap and more overlap as the reads length increases until the last few points.*

**Comment on whether you expect R1s and R2s to be adapter-trimmed at different rates**

We should definitely see expect R1s and R2s to be adapter-trimmed at different rates.


## Part 3 – rRNA reads and strand-specificity

**Find publicly available Drosophila melanogaster rRNA sequences and generate an alignment database (e.g. STAR) from them.**

Downloaded the Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.22.ncrna.fa.gz file from ensembl.org. and did a gunzip.

bash commands to filter rRNA from Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.22.ncrna.fa.gz file

```{r engine = 'bash', eval = FALSE}
awk '/^>/ {printf("\n%s\n",$0);next; } { printf("%s",$0);}  END {printf("\n");}' \
< Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.22.ncrna.fa > out.fa

grep -A 1 "rRNA" out.fa  > Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.22.ncrna_RNA.fa
```

**and report the proportion of reads that likely came from rRNAs**

From the alignnment result and looking into the aligned_RAL306W-F3_S79_L006_rRNA Log.final.out file, rRNA uniquely mapped reads were	1.13%. As for, the aligned_RAL306W_plus_M3_S78_L006_rRNA Log.final.out file, rRNA uniquely mapped reads were	0%. 

These numbers state that 2 trimmed demultiplexed file pair reads of rRNA proportions were small to nothing. This is hard to beleive. There is most likely an incorrect error in running STAR that needs to be explored and corrected. Due to time, I went forward with these alignments to explore further questions.


**Demonstrate convincingly whether or not the data are from “strand-specific” RNA-Seq libraries. There are a few possible strategies to address this problem, but you need only implement one**

From the alignment output result sam file,  we can use the bit wise flag 64, which is "First in pair" and 16, which is "Read reverse strand" to determine the stran-specific. From running this, if we see an even distrubution in forward and reverse, this would mean no strandness. If we see a lopsided distrubution then it would mean strandness.
